 1 INVESTMENT TRENDS IN FOOTBALL FOR 2022
 <br> 
  17/08/2022 In Football Industry, Front Highlight, World Football Summit
  Investment, just as we shared on our “growth flywheel,” is one of the key pillars that drive growth in football, or in any sports ecosystem, along with talent, revenues, and partnerships. We are currently going through a window of change in the sports industry and with it, the investment landscape adapts to the new market dynamics that arise.
  
  The popularity of sports helps it overcome more challenging times. Laurie Pinto, Partner at Pinto Capital, shared on this episode of the “Are you not entertained?” podcast, his belief that the sports industry is quite resilient to economic downturns, and that it is usually more a matter of “confidence” in the evolution of inflation and interest rates that impacts it rather than real economic issues. This is something that we covered in our deep dive into the SportsTech space in WFS Digest.
  
  For this article, we have identified five trends that are shaping the future of football from the investment perspective and adding insights from some of the most recognized experts in the field.

  THE MULTI-CLUB OWNERSHIP MODEL: WHEN FOOTBALL CLUBS BECOME MULTINATIONALS
  This form of governance is quickly gaining traction. City Group may be one of the most popular examples; 10 years after being founded, they already own 10 clubs that help the brand presence in every continent except Africa.
  
  Other groups worth mentioning include: 
  
  Orlegi Sports and Grupo Pachuca, who have recently purchased Sporting Gijon and Real Oviedo respectively, have been able to diversify their businesses into European soil and will probably heat up the rivalry between these two historic Spanish clubs.
  New City Capital Group owns 7 clubs, amongst which we can find Kaiserlautern or Barnsley.
  Redbird Capital Partners have an interesting model as they own football clubs like Liverpool and Toulouse but also other sports properties like the Boston Red Sox.
  777 partners, who own Genoa, and Standard Liege, have a small stake in Sevilla, and Vasco da Gama.
  John Textor is a unique case as in only 12 months he has been able to buy stakes in Crystal Palace, Botafogo, Olympique Lyonnais, and RWD Molenbeek.
