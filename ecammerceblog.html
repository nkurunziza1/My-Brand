  1. Omnichannel presence
  <br>

  Nowadays the practice of omnichannel shopping is common like never before. 56% of people who were shopping in-store used their smartphones to look up products or do product research while they were there. That means customers want to be able to do their research online, even if they are already in the store examining a product. 
  <br>
  <br>
  A consistent customer experience must be created across all consumer touchpoints in omnichannel retail. These touchpoints may include phone calls, online visits, mobile purchases, and in-store interactions. Before making a purchase, a customer may come into contact with your brand through any or all of those channels, and their experience should be consistent.
  
  Here are 4 strategies for how you can increase your omnichannel customer engagement:
  <br>

  
  Personalize your customer shopping experience;<br>
  Make sure your website is mobile-friendly;<br>
  <br>
  Create “bridges” between physical stores and digital channels, providing features like a simple returns procedure and shipping to a variety of places;
  Offer social media customer support.
  <br>
  <br>
  2. Mobile commerce
  <br>

  Technologies are moving forward, and that means mobile commerce is growing. Did you know that there are currently 7.26 billion mobile phone users worldwide, including both smart and feature phones? That means 91% of the world's population owns mobile phones. Further, predictions are that by 2026 mobile device users will increase to 7.516 billion.
  
  For you as an eCommerce retailer, it means that more and more consumers could purchase your products or services through their mobile devices, and they prefer mobile commerce as their shopping channel.
  <br>
  <br>
  Global mobile commerce sales are forecasted to reach almost €4.5 trillion by 2024, providing roughly 69.9% of all retail eCommerce sales. It is crucial to ensure that your website is optimized for mobile viewing given that more than half of all internet traffic is on mobile devices.
  
  Improve the loading time of your website
  
  Your website should load quickly for mobile users. Have you heard that pages  loading within 5 seconds have an average bounce rate of 38%? Optimizing your website loading time will help you not only to lower bounce rates but also improve the user experience.
  
  Make your navigation menu simple
  <br>
  <br>
  Screens on mobile devices are much smaller than those on desktops. Because of that, you'd better keep the navigation menu as compact and user-friendly as possible. Particularly popular is the usage of hamburger menus on mobile versions of websites.
  
  Make your pop-ups mobile friendly
  
  Pop-ups can be quite useful, but can also ruin the mobile experience. Screen space is extremely important on smaller devices, and even medium-sized pop-ups can be much more annoying than they are on your website's desktop edition. Google cracked down pop-ups and implemented a set of rules to follow.
