 As an IT professional, what are some of the technologies you should be looking at? Here are Top 5 Microsoft Technology trends and platforms that you should explore more in detail this year.
 
 1. .Net 5
 <br>
 One of the biggest challenges for developers who develop .NET code is the transition from the old .NET framework to the .NET Core. By the end of this year, you will have the opportunity to see how code will be explored in the future. The current .NET Core 3.1 is a long-term support version with cross-platform accessibility. Porting or transitioning to .NET 3.1 shows you what changes your existing code needs, and also gives you the opportunity to develop a new toolchain. It allows you to combine the best of Core, Xamarin, Framework, and Mono, and publish on Microsoft Azure app services.
