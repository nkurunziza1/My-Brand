1. Special Theory of Relativity <br>
  Einstein proposed his theory of light, stating that all light is composed of tiny packets of energy, called photons. He suggested these photons were particles but also had wave-like properties, a totally new idea at the time.

He also spent some time outlining the emission of electrons from metals as they were hit with large electric pulses, like lightning. He expanded on this concept of the photoelectric effect, which we'll
In Einstein's studies, he began to notice inconsistencies of Newtonian mechanics in their relation to the understanding of electromagnetism, specifically to Maxwell's equations. In a paper published in September 1905, he proposed a new way of thinking about the mechanics of objects approaching the speed of light.

<br>
  This concept became known as Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. It changed the understanding of physics at the time. 

Einstein's revelation was that observers in relative motion experience time differently. He realized that it is possible for two events to happen simultaneously from the perspective of one observer, but occur at different times from the perspective of the other. And both observers would be right.

Understanding the Special Theory of Relativity can be a little difficult, but we'll boil it down to a simple situation. 

He began with the idea that light always travels at a constant 300,000 km/s, and asked what would happen to our ideas of space and time if that was the case?

Now, imagine that you once again have an observer standing on a railway embankment as a train
